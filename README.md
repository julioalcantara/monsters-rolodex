An React "moster-lodex" application from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

## What I learned
* Developed a website using React, Bootstrap. In this websit is getting [ROBOHASH](https://robohash.org/) api to generate random monste's images to be displayed, it also uses an api given by Udemy with generated users information. We are combining both APIs so each moster has its own infomation such as name, username, id, etc.
* The is a custom search bar where the user can find the Monster by its name
